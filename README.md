# War Room

## Setup

Run `nvm use` or install compatible NodeJS version (v22.12.0+)

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

Starts on **http://localhost:3001**. Configuration is read from `server/.env`:

```
TICK_INTERVAL_MS=100       # simulation tick rate (ms)
UNITS_TOTAL=20000          # total units across both teams
UNITS_PER_TICK=500         # units processed per tick (movement/attack)
UNITS_PER_TICK_JITTER=150  # ± random variance on units-per-tick
HEAL_IDLE_TICKS=3          # ticks idle before a unit begins healing
HEAL_AMOUNT=5              # HP restored per healing tick
```

All values have sensible defaults; you can run without editing `.env`.

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Opens on **http://localhost:5173**. The Vite dev server proxies `/stream`, `/units`, `/zones`, and `/health` to `localhost:3001`, so no CORS configuration is needed.

> Start the server first, then the client.

## Running tests

```bash
# Server
cd server && npm test

# Client
cd client && npm test
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Server

- **ECS with bitecs** — 20,000 units are stored in flat typed arrays (`Float32Array`, `Int32Array`, avoids strings in ECS) via the bitecs entity-component system. Zero per-entity heap allocation in the hot path. Access: `Position.x[eid]` → O(1). This keeps GC pressure negligible and tick throughput high even at 10 Hz.
  - Attack system is the most resource heavy one (most comparisons per tick of any system) but it should run well at 1s tick:
    O(n) scan for attack target lookup is ~7M comparisons/tick (350 × 20,000 = 7,000,000 comparisons). A single comparison is just arithmetic. Modern JS engines execute these at roughly 1 billion simple operations per second. Currently the budget is 1,000ms (1s tick). Spending 5ms of it on the scan is 0.5% of the budget. The other 995ms the server is idle. 
    Optimizations like Spatial Index is not necessary at this point, but should be relatively easy to implement given that systems are isolated.
  - Capture system's zone membership check (6 × 20k = 120k comparisons) is an order of magnitude cheaper than the Attack system.
  - Heal system   The inner zone loop (6 iterations) only fires for units that are IDLE and have accumulated ≥ HEAL_IDLE_TICKS consecutive idle ticks. In the true worst case
   — all 20,000 units idle and eligible — that adds another 20,000 × 6 = 120,000 zone distance checks on top.


- **`liveEntities` shared array** — a single mutable `number[]` holds every non-dead entity ID. All three systems (move, attack, idle/heal) iterate over this instead of scanning all 20k slots each tick. When a unit dies, the attack system splices it out immediately, keeping the iteration set small as the battle progresses.

- **Delta-only SSE transport** — on connect the client receives a full snapshot (~20k units, sent once). Every subsequent tick carries only the 200–350 entity IDs whose state actually changed (`UnitDelta[]`). This keeps the per-tick payload well under 20 KB regardless of unit count.

- **Ticker as EventEmitter** — the 1 Hz tick loop lives in a dedicated `Ticker` class that emits `'tick'` events. Each tick is wrapped in try/catch so a single bad frame cannot kill the interval. The SSE handler simply subscribes to the emitter; transport and simulation are fully decoupled.

- **Zod input validation** — all query parameters (filter endpoints, SSE params) are validated with Zod schemas. `hpMin`/`hpMax` cross-field validation returns HTTP 400 before touching simulation state.

### Client

- **PixiJS ParticleContainer** — all 20,000 units are rendered as `PIXI.Particle` sprites in a single `ParticleContainer`, which issues one WebGL draw call per frame. DOM rendering for map dots is explicitly avoided; at this scale it would be unusable.

- **`resizeTo` + `autoDensity`** — the PixiJS app uses `resizeTo: el` so the renderer owns canvas sizing, combined with `autoDensity: true` and `resolution: devicePixelRatio`. This produces sharp rendering on retina displays without manual canvas scaling math.

- **Zustand store with new Map references** — `applyDeltas` always produces a `new Map(state.units)` so both React `useMemo` hooks and PixiJS's `useStore.subscribe` fire reliably on every tick. The PixiJS subscriber bypasses React's render cycle entirely — only KPI counts and the unit list trigger React re-renders.

- **TanStack Virtual for the unit list** — the 20k-row list renders only ~15 rows at a time. Filtering and sorting are applied inside a `useMemo`; the virtualiser never sees more rows than the filtered subset.

- **`usePerf` at 2 Hz** — FPS and heap samples are accumulated into refs at 60 Hz but flushed to the Zustand store only every 500 ms. This means the perf panel causes at most 2 React re-renders per second instead of 60.

- **No RegExp on user input** — the unit search filter uses `String.prototype.includes()` throughout. `new RegExp(userInput)` is never called, eliminating ReDoS exposure.
